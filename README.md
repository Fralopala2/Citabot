# Citabot

Citabot is a Flutter app for Android that automates the search for available appointments in services, including ITV (vehicle inspection). The app connects to a robust Python FastAPI backend that performs real-time scraping, delivers accurate appointment data, and sends **automatic push notifications** when new appointments become available.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîî **Automatic Push Notifications**

- **Real-time monitoring**: Backend checks for new free appointments every 1 hour
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Notifications work even when app is closed
- **Smart detection**: Only notifies when genuinely new appointments appear
- **Works 24/7**: No need to keep the app open or check manually

### üì± **Modern User Experience**

- Clean, intuitive, and responsive Material Design interface
- Custom loading indicators with animations and informative messages
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly feedback
- Smooth navigation and interactive elements

### üéØ **Smart Appointment Search**

- Search for **real ITV appointments** by province, station, and service type
- **Favorites system**: Save preferred stations for quick access
- **Bulk search**: Find earliest available appointment across all favorite stations
- **Date filtering**: Automatically excludes past dates from results
- Real-time availability with accurate dates, times, and prices

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Performance**

- **Restricted CORS policy**: Backend only accepts requests from known domains
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful scraping to avoid service disruption
- **Intelligent caching**: 30-minute cache with background refresh
- **Environment-based configuration**: Separate settings for development and production

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.x
- Android Studio or Android emulator API 33/34+
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI and Uvicorn for the backend

### For Developers

#### Backend Development

1. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   cd citabot-backend
   cp .env.example .env
   cp firebase-service-account.json.example firebase-service-account.json
   # Edit both files with your Firebase credentials
   ```

   cd citabot_app/android/app
   cp google-services.json.example google-services.json
   # Edit with your Firebase Android configuration
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   cd citabot_app
   flutter run
   ```

## Project Structure

- `citabot_app/` ‚Äî Flutter source code (Android only)
- `citabot-backend/` ‚Äî Python FastAPI backend

## üöÄ Backend Endpoints

### Core Functionality

- `GET /itv/estaciones` ‚Äî Returns all real ITV stations and provinces
- `GET /itv/servicios` ‚Äî Returns available services for a specific station
- `GET /itv/fechas` ‚Äî Returns next available dates and times for ITV appointments
- `GET /cita-nia` ‚Äî Returns simulated NIA appointments

### Push Notifications

- `POST /register-token` ‚Äî Registers FCM device token for notifications
- `POST /notifications/test` ‚Äî Test endpoint to send notification to specific token
- `GET /notifications/stats` ‚Äî Returns notification system statistics

### System Monitoring

- `GET /cache/status` ‚Äî Returns cache status and refresh intervals
- `POST /cache/clear` ‚Äî Manually clears all cached data
- `GET /debug/fechas` ‚Äî Debug endpoint for raw scraper data
- `GET /` ‚Äî Health check endpoint

## üîß Configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Configuration Files

**Before running the project, you must configure the sensitive files:**

#### Backend (Firebase and environment variables):

```bash
cd citabot-backend
cp .env.example .env
cp firebase-service-account.json.example firebase-service-account.json
```

Then edit both files with your real Firebase credentials.

#### Flutter App (Google Services):

```bash
cd citabot_app/android/app
cp google-services.json.example google-services.json
```

Edit the file with your Firebase configuration for Android.

### Environment Variables

The `.env` file in `citabot-backend/` should contain:

```env
# Firebase Configuration (for push notifications)
FIREBASE_CONFIG={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project",...}

# Cache Configuration (optional)
CACHE_TTL=1800  # 30 minutes cache duration
BACKGROUND_REFRESH_INTERVAL=1800  # 30 minutes between automatic checks
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=2  # Limit concurrent scraping requests
REQUEST_DELAY=5.0  # Seconds between requests to be respectful

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=production  # or "development"
```

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create Firebase project** at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. **Enable Cloud Messaging** in your project
3. **Generate service account key**:
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Download the JSON file
4. **Configure environment**:
   - For local development: Save as `firebase-service-account.json`
   - For production (Render): Set `FIREBASE_CONFIG` environment variable with the JSON content
