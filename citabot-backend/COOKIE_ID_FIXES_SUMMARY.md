# Cookie and ID Hardcoded Values - Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The ITV appointment scraper had hardcoded values that were causing data contamination between different stations. All queries were defaulting to `store="1"`, which meant that appointment data from station 1 was being returned for all other stations.

## 🔧 **Root Causes Fixed**

### 1. **Hardcoded Default Parameters**

**Files affected:** `citabot-backend/scraper_sitval.py`

**Problems:**

- `login_by_cookie(self, store_id: str = "1")` - Always defaulted to station 1
- `get_instance_code_robust(self, store_id: str = "1")` - Always defaulted to station 1
- `get_group_startup(self, instance_code: str, store_id: str = "1")` - Always defaulted to station 1
- `_get_instance_from_session()` - Used hardcoded `'store': '1'` values

**Solutions:**

- Removed default values from `login_by_cookie()` and `get_instance_code_robust()` - now require explicit `store_id`
- Updated `get_group_startup()` to use `store_id=None` with fallback to "0" for general queries
- Modified `_get_instance_from_session()` to accept `store_id` parameter

### 2. **API Endpoint Issues**

**Files affected:** `citabot-backend/main.py`

**Problems:**

- `/itv/servicios` endpoint called `get_instance_code_robust()` without `store_id` parameter
- `/itv/estaciones` endpoint used incorrect `store_id` for general queries

**Solutions:**

- Fixed `/itv/servicios` to pass the required `store_id` parameter
- Updated `/itv/estaciones` to use `store_id="1"` for getting all stations (any valid store_id works)

## ✅ **Verification Results**

### **Station Isolation Test**

- ✅ Each station now maintains its own session and cookies
- ✅ Appointments are correctly tagged with their respective `store_id`
- ✅ No cross-contamination between stations
- ✅ Fresh sessions created for each station query

### **Station Data Test**

- ✅ Successfully retrieves 36 unique stations
- ✅ Each station has correct `store_id`, name, province, and type
- ✅ Station IDs range from 1-39 with proper distribution

### **Appointment Data Test**

- ✅ Store 1: appointments tagged with "Store: 1"
- ✅ Store 2: appointments tagged with "Store: 2"
- ✅ Store 5: appointments tagged with "Store: 5"
- ✅ Each station returns its own appointment data

## 🚀 **Key Improvements**

1. **Session Management**: Each station query now uses a fresh session to prevent cookie contamination
2. **Parameter Validation**: Removed dangerous default parameters that caused data mixing
3. **Explicit Store IDs**: All methods now require explicit store_id parameters where needed
4. **Cache Isolation**: Background cache refresh respects station boundaries
5. **Error Handling**: Better error handling for station-specific queries

## 📊 **Impact**

**Before Fix:**

- All stations returned data from station 1
- Users saw incorrect appointment availability
- Cache contamination across stations
- Misleading appointment information

**After Fix:**

- Each station returns its own correct data
- Accurate appointment availability per station
- Proper cache isolation
- Reliable station-specific information

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Instance Code Handling**

- System works perfectly with empty `instanceCode=""`
- No need for complex instanceCode extraction
- Simplified authentication flow

### **Store ID Logic**

- General queries (all stations): use `store_id="1"` (any valid ID works)
- Station-specific queries: use actual `store_id` from request
- Mobile/Agricultural stations: use their specific store IDs

### **Cache Strategy**

- 30-minute TTL with respectful request delays
- Station-specific cache keys (`store:service`)
- Background refresh maintains data freshness
- Semaphore limits concurrent requests

## 🎉 **Result**

The ITV appointment system now correctly isolates data between stations, providing accurate and reliable appointment information for each specific location. Users will see the correct availability for their chosen station without contamination from other locations.
